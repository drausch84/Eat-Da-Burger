# Eat-Da-Burger

### Technologies Used

Node.js, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, Javascript, and Materialize for the CSS

### What Does It Do?

Feeling hungry?  If you answered "no", then I don't know what to tell you.  However, if you gave an enthusiastic "yes"; this is the app for you!

Eat-Da-Burger is an example of a full stack application that allows the user to add any burger that he or she wants and watch as it is submitted to the page of the application.

When this burger is added by the user, the burger is also stored into a MySQL database.  And when the user clicks on the burger to eat or "devour" it, it will move to an adjacent column to indicate as such.
